# point-position-neural-network
A simple neural network created with python and keras-tensoreflow which predicts the postion of a given point with respect to a give function.

The model provided is created and trained to predict weather a given point is above or below the curve f(x)

For trying out the model run the ```point-line neural network model prediction.ipynb``` file which is for only making prediction with the saved model. For changing and for the complete code of the training process checkout ```Point-Position-Predictor-Keras.ipynb``` file.

The model in the repository is trained for the function ``` y = x ```

Python modules required ```numpy``` ```tensorflow``` ```sklearn``` ```matplotlib```

The above program is created using anaconda(python)
